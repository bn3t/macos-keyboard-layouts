MacOS keyboard layouts I might need

# Install

I have found that it works best when installed for all users. If not some Apple apps refuse to use this keyboard and revert to the default one.

    sudo cp Belgian\ \(Microsoft\ Keyboard\).keylayout /Library/Keyboard\ Layouts

# To edit

Maybe best to use Ukulele tool. http://software.sil.org/ukelele/

## Belgian (Microsoft Keyboard).keylayout

Belgian Keyboard with specifics for the Microsoft Keyboard. It is customised to keep '{' and '}' available with Option + 5 and Option + ) as it is working this way when on the MacBook Pro keyboard.
